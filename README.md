## ðŸŽ‰ Fun Fact About Me

When I'm not diving deep into datasets or building interactive dashboards, you can find me immersed in the world of philosophy. 

ðŸ“š I'm a big fan of Indian and Western philosophy, and I've read a variety of books on these subjects. The concepts of Advaitvada and Strict Monism? Absolutely fascinating! 

And if you ever want to chat about philosophy, just mention Immanuel Kantâ€”he's my favorite philosopher. His ideas on metaphysics and epistemology have left quite an impression on me!
